By applying the leads of a power supply to one resistive track and reading a voltage signal from the other resistive track, a potentiometric signal related to the position of the throttle blade is developed.
Integral with the resistive track developing the position signal is a protection resistor providing shorting protection in case of the misconnection of the power and signal terminals.
An electrical resistance apparatus adapted for the measurement of the position of the throttle blade of an internal combustion engine is disclosed.
The apparatus includes a generally annular housing which has an inside surface that supports a flexible resistive element.
The resistive element comprises a flexible web on which two parallel resistive tracks have been overlaid.
A generally cylindrical rotor mounts within the housing and electrically couples the two tracks by means of a U-shaped conductive wiper that bridges the separation between the resistive tracks.
The rotor is mechanically connected to the throttle blade of the internal combustion engine and rotates therewith.
