The resistive element includes a first contact point connected to a capacitor terminal, a second contact point connected to a circuit board plane, and resistive material connected to the first and second contact points.
An electrical resistance apparatus adapted for the measurement of the position of the throttle blade of an internal combustion engine is disclosed.
A generally cylindrical rotor mounts within the housing and electrically couples the two tracks by means of a U-shaped conductive wiper that bridges the separation between the resistive tracks.
The rotor is mechanically connected to the throttle blade of the internal combustion engine and rotates therewith.
Integral with the resistive track developing the position signal is a protection resistor providing shorting protection in case of the misconnection of the power and signal terminals.
